## 🎯 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Features
- [x] **Lazy Loading**: Crisp SDK loads asynchronously, no performance impact
- [x] **User Identification**: Automatic user identification with Clerk
- [x] **User Context**: Fetches subscription, credits, and team data from backend
- [x] **Multi-Language**: Automatically sets chat locale (English/Spanish)
- [x] **Environment Tracking**: Sends environment info to dashboard (dev/qa/production)

### ✅ Noise Management
- [x] **Smart Delays**: 5s (dev), 10s (qa), 15s (production) before showing widget
- [x] **Path-Based Hiding**: Hides widget on `/auth` pages by default
- [x] **Environment-Specific Behavior**: Different configurations per environment

### ✅ User Context Sent to Crisp Dashboard
When a user chats, your support team will see:
- User's name, email, avatar (from Clerk)
- Environment (dev/qa/production)
- Subscription plan, status, period end
- Credit balance, last purchase date
- Team ID, team name, role (owner/member)
- Clerk user ID

```

### Check 2: User Identified
```javascript
// In browser console:
"Crisp chat user identified"
"Crisp chat user context loaded successfully"
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Development
```bash
# Already configured in GitHub Actions
# Deploys automatically on push to main branch
```

### QA
```bash
cd frontend
npm run tag:create
# Select 'qa' when prompted
# GitHub Actions will deploy with CRISP_WEBSITE_ID secret
```

### Production
```bash
cd frontend
npm run tag:create
# Select 'prod' when prompted
# GitHub Actions will deploy with CRISP_WEBSITE_ID secret
```

**Note**: All environments use the same `CRISP_WEBSITE_ID` GitHub secret.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Widget Doesn't Appear

**Check 1**: Environment variable set?
```bash
# In browser console (F12)
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_CRISP_WEBSITE_ID)
# Should output: "abcdef12-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcdef123456"
```

**Check 2**: Website ID correct?
- Go to Crisp dashboard → Settings → Website Settings
- Verify Website ID matches your environment variable

**Check 3**: Domain allowed?
- Go to Crisp dashboard → Settings → Allowed Domains
- Verify your domain is listed

**Check 4**: Ad blocker?
- Disable ad blocker and refresh page

### Messages Don't Appear in Dashboard

**Check 1**: Right website selected?
- In Crisp dashboard, verify "iCraftStories" is selected in top-left dropdown

**Check 2**: Check inbox filters?
- Click "All" in left sidebar to see all messages

### User Context Not Showing

**Check 1**: User signed in?
- User context only loads for authenticated users
- Try signing in with a test account

**Check 2**: Check browser console for errors?
```javascript
// Look for these errors:
"Failed to load Crisp user context"
"Failed to fetch subscription"
```

**Check 3**: API endpoints working?
- Verify `/v1/user/subscription`, `/v1/user/credits`, `/v1/user/team` are accessible
