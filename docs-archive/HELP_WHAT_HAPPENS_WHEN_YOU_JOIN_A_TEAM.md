## Quick Answer

When you join a team, **all your personal stories and credits automatically transfer to the team**. This transfer is permanent - you can't move them back to your personal account later.

## The Complete Story

### What Gets Transferred?

#### 📚 Your Stories (Except Community Remixes)

**Transferred to team**:
- All stories you created yourself
- Stories you're actively working on
- Published and draft stories

**Stay with you**:
- Stories you remixed from the community
- These are your personal copies and won't be shared

**After transfer**:
- Team members can view all your stories
- Team members can edit your stories
- Stories show as "team stories" in your library
- You can still edit them, but they're shared

#### 💎 Your Credits

**Transferred to team**:
- All unused credits from purchases
- Credits from your personal subscription
- Trial credits (if any)

**After transfer**:
- Credits go into the team's shared pool
- Team owner manages credit distribution
- You use team credits for new stories

#### 📱 Your Subscription

**If you have an Individual or Trial subscription**:
- It gets automatically canceled
- No refund for unused subscription time
- You get access to the team's subscription instead
- No interruption to your service

**If you have no subscription**:
- Nothing changes
- You gain access to the team subscription

### Before You Accept

When you receive a team invitation, you'll see exactly what will be transferred:

```
Important: What Happens When You Join

• Stories: All 5 of your personal stories will become team stories
• Credits: All 150 of your personal credits will be transferred to the team
• Subscription: Your individual subscription will be canceled

[Cancel] [Accept & Join Team]
```

**Take a moment to review** these numbers before clicking "Accept & Join Team."

### After You Accept

#### What You'll See Immediately

1. **Success Message**: Confirmation that you joined the team
2. **Team Dashboard**: Access to team management page
3. **Shared Stories**: Your stories now show team badge
4. **Team Credits**: Your credit balance now shows team total

#### What Happens Behind the Scenes

The system automatically:
1. Moves your stories to team ownership
2. Transfers your credits to team pool
3. Cancels your individual subscription (if any)
4. Logs the transfer in your activity history
5. Creates a team member record for you

This all happens in seconds, and you'll be redirected to your team page.

### Common Questions

#### Can I get my stories back if I leave the team?

**No.** Story transfers are permanent. If you leave the team:
- Stories stay with the team
- Team members keep access
- You cannot recover them

**Before joining**: Make sure you're comfortable sharing these stories with the team.

#### Can I get my credits back if I leave the team?

**No.** Credit transfers are permanent. If you leave:
- Credits stay in the team pool
- You don't get them back
- You'll need to purchase or subscribe individually

#### What if I don't want to transfer everything?

**You can't selectively transfer.** It's all-or-nothing:
- Can't choose which stories to transfer
- Can't keep some credits
- Can't maintain personal subscription

**Options**:
- Don't join the team if you want to keep things separate
- Download/export stories before joining (if you want backups)
- Use a different account for team work

#### What happens to my subscription payment?

**No refund for unused time.** If you have 15 days left on your Individual plan:
- Subscription cancels immediately
- No prorated refund
- You use team subscription going forward

**Why?** The team subscription is usually better value, so you benefit from the team plan right away.

#### Can the team owner see my story ideas or drafts?

**Yes.** All transferred stories become team property:
- Team members can view drafts
- Team members can edit your stories
- Team owner has full access

**Privacy tip**: If you have private story ideas, keep them in a separate personal account.

### Team Subscription Upgrades

#### If You Upgrade to a Team Plan

When you upgrade your subscription from Individual → Team:

1. **Team Auto-Created**: A team is created for you
2. **You're the Owner**: You control the team
3. **Same Transfer Happens**: Stories/credits/subscription transfer
4. **Invite Others**: You can now invite team members

This is the same transfer process, except YOU become the team owner.

### Troubleshooting

#### I accepted the invitation but don't see my stories in the team

**Likely causes**:
1. Transfer still processing (wait 30 seconds and refresh)
2. You're looking at "My Stories" instead of "Team Stories"
3. Transfer failed (check activity log)

**Fix**: Refresh the page and check the "Team" tab in your library.

#### My credits didn't transfer

**Check these**:
1. Refresh the page to see updated balance
2. Check team credit balance (not personal)
3. Look for transfer activity in activity log

**Still missing?** Contact support with your user ID and team ID.

#### I didn't realize it was permanent - can I undo it?

**Sorry, no.** Team transfers are permanent and cannot be reversed.

**Prevention**: The confirmation screen shows exactly what transfers - always review before accepting.

### Best Practices

#### Before Joining a Team

✅ **Review what transfers**: Check story count and credit balance
