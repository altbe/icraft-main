### REQ-INV-003: Pre-Invitation Team Membership Check
**Status**: ✅ Implemented (2025-10-23)
**Priority**: High

**Requirements:**
- Validate user's team status before sending invitation
- Check if email is already member of another team
- Check if email owns another team
- Show informational dialog (not error) if user already has team
- Prevent sending invitation that will fail on acceptance

**Implementation:**
- **Stored Procedure**: `check_user_team_membership_by_email(p_email TEXT)`
- **Files**:
  - `backend/sql/check-user-team-membership-by-email.sql`
  - `backend/scripts/migrations/011_check_user_team_membership_nonprod.sql`
  - `backend/scripts/migrations/011_check_user_team_membership_prod.sql`
- **Returns**: Team details if user is in a team, NULL otherwise

**Usage in API** (`backend/modules/clerk-team-invitations.ts:144-172`):
```typescript
// Check if user is already in another team (one-team-per-user constraint)
const { data: existingMembership } = await supabase
  .rpc('check_user_team_membership_by_email', { p_email: email });

if (existingMembership && existingMembership.length > 0) {
  const membership = existingMembership[0];
  return HttpProblems.badRequest(request, context, {
    detail: `User is already ${membership.is_owner ? 'owner of' : 'a member of'} ${membership.team_name}`,
    code: membership.is_owner ? 'USER_ALREADY_OWNS_TEAM' : 'USER_ALREADY_IN_TEAM',
    metadata: {
      existingTeamName: membership.team_name,
      existingTeamId: membership.team_id,
      userRole: membership.user_role
    }
  });
}
```

**Frontend Handling** (`frontend/src/components/TeamInvitationDialog.tsx:96-106`):
```typescript
// Check for specific error codes from backend
if (errorCode === 'USER_ALREADY_IN_TEAM' && metadata?.existingTeamName) {
  setError(t('invitation.userAlreadyInTeam', {
    email: email.trim().toLowerCase(),
    teamName: metadata.existingTeamName
  }));
} else if (errorCode === 'USER_ALREADY_OWNS_TEAM' && metadata?.existingTeamName) {
  setError(t('invitation.userAlreadyOwnsTeam', {
    email: email.trim().toLowerCase(),
    teamName: metadata.existingTeamName
  }));
}
```

**Database Constraint**: One-team-per-user enforced by migration 002
- `idx_team_members_one_per_user` - Unique index on `team_members(user_id)`
- `idx_teams_one_owner` - Unique index on `teams(owner_id)`

**Security - Zod-Based Input Validation:**
- **Frontend** (`TeamInvitationService.ts:158-236`):
  - **Zod Schema**: Type-safe email validation with sanitization transform
  - **Built-in Validation**: Zod's `.email()` validator (RFC 5322 compliant)
  - **Custom Refine**: Injection pattern detection (XSS, protocol injection, directory traversal)
  - **Length Validation**: 3-320 characters enforced by schema
  - **Method**: `validateEmail()` returns `{valid, error?, sanitized?}` for detailed feedback
  - **Real-Time UX**: Progressive validation with visual feedback (green/yellow/red borders)
- **Backend** (`clerk-team-invitations.ts:19-83`):
  - **Zod Schema**: Consistent validation with frontend
  - **Transform**: Auto-sanitization (trim, lowercase, remove control chars/HTML)
  - **Refine**: Same injection pattern detection as frontend
  - **Error Messages**: Zod provides detailed, user-friendly error messages
  - **Security Logging**: Failed validations logged with input preview
  - **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type inference from schema

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Stored procedure created in both databases (non-prod and prod)
- ✅ API validates before sending Clerk invitation (fail-open strategy)
- ✅ Frontend shows informational message with team name
- ✅ No invitations sent to users already in teams
- ✅ Clear error messages with specific error codes

**Implementation:**
- **Database Constraint**: `CHECK (role IN ('owner', 'member'))`
- **Migration**: `backend/scripts/migrations/010_add_role_constraint_nonprod.sql`

**Role Mapping:**
- Clerk `admin` → Team `member` (no more admin role)
- Clerk `basic_member` → Team `member`
- Team `owner` role is application-specific (not in Clerk)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Database constraint prevents admin role insertion

   - Skips subscription cancellation (no subscription to cancel)
   - Logs `team_join` activity with metadata

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "creditsTransferred": 0,
  "storiesTransferred": 0,
  "subscriptionCancelled": false
}
```

**Test Case:**
```sql
SELECT onboard_team_member('user_34QVci9hMiAU0rN3K6qB1mBbv8W', '<team_id>');
-- Expected: success, 0 credits, 0 stories, no subscription cancelled
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Has personal stories (e.g., 5 stories)
- Active subscription to cancel

**Onboarding Process:**
1. User accepts Clerk invitation
2. Webhook creates team member record
3. Stored procedure executes:
   - Transfers ALL user credits to team (50 credits → team)
   - Transfers ALL user stories to team (5 stories → team)
   - Cancels individual/trial subscription (status → 'canceled')
   - Logs subscription cancellation to system_logs
   - Logs `team_join` activity with full transfer details

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "creditsTransferred": 50,
  "storiesTransferred": 5,
  "subscriptionCancelled": true,
  "cancelledPlanId": "trial"
}
```

**Database State After:**
```sql
-- User credits: 0
SELECT credit_balance FROM user_profiles WHERE id = '<user_id>';

-- Team credits: +50
SELECT credit_balance FROM teams WHERE id = '<team_id>';

-- Stories transferred
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stories WHERE user_id = '<user_id>' AND team_id = '<team_id>';
-- Returns: 5

-- Subscription cancelled
SELECT status FROM subscriptions WHERE user_id = '<user_id>';
-- Returns: 'canceled'
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ ALL credits transferred (none remain personal)
- ✅ ALL stories transferred to team ownership
- ✅ Individual/trial subscription cancelled
- ✅ User can no longer use personal subscription benefits
- ✅ User uses team subscription and credits going forward

- Has active team-eligible subscription (team OR custom_*)
- Has personal credits (e.g., 100 credits)
- Has personal stories (e.g., 3 stories)

**Team Creation Process:**
1. User navigates to `/team-management`
2. User enters team name and clicks "Create Team"
3. API creates Clerk Organization
4. API calls `create_team_with_owner_and_transfer_all()`
5. Stored procedure executes:
   - Creates team record with clerk_org_id
   - Adds owner as team_member (role: 'owner', can_manage_credits: true)
   - Transfers ALL user credits to team
   - **Does NOT transfer stories** (owner's stories remain personal)
   - Logs `team_create` activity

**Expected Result:**
```json
{
  "creditsTransferred": 100,
  "storiesTransferred": 0,
  "teamCreated": true
}
```

**Database State After:**
```sql
-- Team created with Clerk org
SELECT clerk_org_id FROM teams WHERE id = '<team_id>';
-- Returns: org_clerk_xxx

-- Owner credits: 0
SELECT credit_balance FROM user_profiles WHERE id = '<owner_id>';

-- Team credits: 100
SELECT credit_balance FROM teams WHERE id = '<team_id>';

-- Personal stories: Still 3 (team_id = NULL)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stories WHERE user_id = '<owner_id>' AND team_id IS NULL;
-- Returns: 3 (stories NOT transferred)
```

**Story Transfer Rationale:**
- **Owner**: Pre-existing stories remain personal (user's portfolio)

- No reliance on RLS (using service keys)

**Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Backend membership validation
export async function getTeamData(request: ZuploRequest, context: ZuploContext) {
  const userId = request.headers.get('X-User-Id');
  const teamId = request.params.teamId;

  // Validate membership
  const { data: member } = await supabase
    .from('team_members')
    .select('role')
    .eq('team_id', teamId)
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .single();

  if (!member) {
    return HttpProblems.forbidden(request, context, {
      detail: 'Not a team member'
    });
  }

  // Proceed with operation
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Non-members cannot access team data
- ✅ API returns 403 for non-members
- ✅ Frontend hides team features for non-members
- ✅ Database queries filter by team_id

### REQ-SEC-002: Permission-Based Access Control
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Priority**: Critical

**Requirements:**
- Role-based permissions enforced at API level
- Owner-only operations validated
- Credit permissions checked before usage
- Clear error messages for permission denied

**Permission Validation:**
```typescript
// Owner-only operation
if (member.role !== 'owner') {
  return HttpProblems.forbidden(request, context, {
    detail: 'Only team owners can perform this action',
    code: 'OWNER_ONLY'
  });
}

// Credit usage permission
if (!member.can_use_credits) {
  return HttpProblems.forbidden(request, context, {
    detail: 'No permission to use team credits',
    code: 'CREDIT_PERMISSION_DENIED'
  });
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Owner-only operations blocked for members
- ✅ Credit operations require appropriate permissions
- ✅ API returns clear error codes
- ✅ Frontend disables unauthorized actions

---

### REQ-SEC-003: Data Isolation
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Priority**: Critical

**Requirements:**
- Team data isolated by team_id
- User can only access teams they belong to
- Credit transactions properly attributed
- Audit trails maintain user context

**Database Filtering:**
```sql
-- All team queries must filter by team_id
SELECT * FROM stories
WHERE team_id = '<team_id>';

-- Validate user membership before queries
SELECT * FROM team_members
WHERE team_id = '<team_id>'
  AND user_id = '<user_id>';
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ No cross-team data leakage
- ✅ All queries filtered by team_id
- ✅ User can only see their teams
- ✅ Audit trails capture correct user context

<InvitationsSection>
  {invitations.length === 0 ? (
    <EmptyState message="No pending invitations" />
  ) : (
    <InvitationsList invitations={invitations} />
  )}
</InvitationsSection>
