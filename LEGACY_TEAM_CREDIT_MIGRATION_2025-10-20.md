# Legacy Team Credit Migration Results

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: ✅ Completed Successfully
**Affected Teams**: 1 (non-prod only)

---

## Executive Summary

Discovered and fixed one legacy team ("travel") in non-prod where the owner's personal credits were not transferred to the team. This team was created **before** the auto-transfer migration was deployed.

**Result**: Successfully migrated 755 credits from owner to team with full audit trail.

**Production Impact**: ZERO teams require migration in production.

---

## Issue Discovery

### Problem Identification
During team data audit, discovered the "travel" team had:
- ✅ Owner correctly added to `team_members` table
- ✅ Owner has correct permissions
- ❌ Owner still has 755 personal credits
- ❌ Team has NULL credit_balance (no team profile)

### Root Cause
The "travel" team was created on **2025-10-20 02:17:33 UTC**, which was **before** the auto-transfer migration was deployed. At that time, the system did not automatically:
1. Create team credit profiles in `user_profiles`
2. Transfer owner's personal credits to the team

## Migration Script Created

**Location**: `backend/sql/migrate-legacy-team-credits.sql`

**Features**:
- Identifies all teams where owner has personal credits > 0
- Creates team credit profiles if missing
- Transfers credits using `transfer_all_user_credits_to_team()` function
- Full transaction audit trail
- Comprehensive logging

**Safety Features**:
- Uses existing stored procedure (already tested and proven)
- Atomic transactions (automatic rollback on error)
- Creates proper credit_transactions records
- Includes verification queries

## Migration Execution

### Non-Production (jjpbogjufnqzsgiiaqwn)

**Before Migration**:
```json
{
  "team_id": "c98ad5c8-a6da-4de3-9f3a-3061575b6398",
  "team_name": "travel",
  "owner_id": "user_32p9LGMsD64veVmf5EEqzBl1cDZ",
  "owner_email": "travel@altgene.net",
  "owner_personal_credits": 755,
  "team_credit_balance": null,
  "team_profile_status": "No team profile"
}
```

**Migration Applied**: 2025-10-20 09:12:16 UTC

**After Migration**:
```json
{
  "team_id": "c98ad5c8-a6da-4de3-9f3a-3061575b6398",
  "team_name": "travel",
  "owner_id": "user_32p9LGMsD64veVmf5EEqzBl1cDZ",
  "owner_email": "travel@altgene.net",
  "owner_personal_credits": 0,
  "team_credit_balance": 755,
  "migration_status": "✅ Migration successful"
}
```

**Credit Transactions Created**:

1. **Owner Debit**:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "f47c2a6a-2e93-42c3-9298-c69f97ef14b7",
     "user_id": "user_32p9LGMsD64veVmf5EEqzBl1cDZ",
     "amount": -755,
     "transaction_type": "transfer_to_team",
     "description": "Legacy migration: Transferred 755 credits from travel@altgene.net",
     "metadata": {
       "to_team_id": "c98ad5c8-a6da-4de3-9f3a-3061575b6398",
       "balance_after": 0
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Team Credit**:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "325a327d-79d5-4537-ad7a-4159357f573e",
     "team_id": "c98ad5c8-a6da-4de3-9f3a-3061575b6398",
     "amount": 755,
     "transaction_type": "transfer_from_user",
     "description": "Legacy migration: Transferred 755 credits from travel@altgene.net",
     "metadata": {
       "from_user_id": "user_32p9LGMsD64veVmf5EEqzBl1cDZ",
       "balance_after": 755,
       "transaction_id": "f47c2a6a-2e93-42c3-9298-c69f97ef14b7"
     }
   }
   ```

**Result**: ✅ 1 team processed, 755 credits transferred

### Production (lgkjfymwvhcjvfkuidis)

**Query Results**: ZERO teams found requiring migration

**Status**: ✅ No migration needed

All production teams either:
1. Were created after the auto-transfer feature was deployed, OR
2. Have already had credits properly transferred

---

## Verification Results

### Non-Production
✅ Query for teams with owner credits > 0: **0 rows returned**
✅ All team credit balances verified correct
✅ All transaction records created successfully

### Production
✅ Query for teams with owner credits > 0: **0 rows returned**
✅ No legacy teams requiring migration

## Migration Summary

| Environment | Teams Found | Teams Processed | Credits Transferred | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| Non-Prod    | 1           | 1               | 755                 | ✅ Complete |
| Production  | 0           | 0               | 0                   | ✅ N/A |

## Technical Implementation

### Database Functions Used
- `transfer_all_user_credits_to_team()` - Core transfer logic
- `user_profiles` table - Team credit storage
- `credit_transactions` table - Audit trail

### Transaction Flow
1. Check if team has credit profile in `user_profiles`
2. Create profile if missing (with 0 balance)
3. Call `transfer_all_user_credits_to_team()`:
   - Deduct from owner's `credit_balance`
   - Add to team's `credit_balance`
   - Create debit transaction for owner
   - Create credit transaction for team
   - Link transactions via `transaction_id` metadata
4. Verify final balances

---

## Lessons Learned

### Why This Happened
The "travel" team in non-prod was created during the **testing window** between:
- ❌ Old logic: Create team, don't transfer credits
- ✅ New logic: Create team, auto-transfer all credits

### Prevention
This issue **cannot recur** because:
1. ✅ Auto-transfer is now built into `create_team_with_owner_and_transfer_all()`
2. ✅ All new teams automatically transfer owner credits
3. ✅ All new team joins automatically transfer member credits

### Maintenance
- Run `team-data-maintenance.sql` quarterly to audit team data
- Monitor for teams where owner has personal credits (should always be 0)

## Files Created

1. **`backend/sql/migrate-legacy-team-credits.sql`**
   Purpose: Migration script with verification queries

2. **`LEGACY_TEAM_CREDIT_MIGRATION_2025-10-20.md`**
   Purpose: This documentation file

---

## Recommendations

### For Non-Production
✅ Migration complete - no further action required

### For Production
✅ No migration needed - all data correct

### For Ongoing Monitoring
1. **Quarterly Audit**: Run `team-data-maintenance.sql` every 3 months
2. **Alert on Anomalies**: Monitor for teams where owner has personal credits > 0
3. **New Team Validation**: Verify credits transfer within 24 hours of team creation

---

## Conclusion

Successfully identified and fixed the only legacy team with incorrect credit distribution. The migration script worked perfectly, creating full audit trail with paired debit/credit transactions.

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Production Impact**: None (no legacy teams found)
**Data Integrity**: 100% verified
