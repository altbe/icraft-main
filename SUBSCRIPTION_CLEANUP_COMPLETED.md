## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did This Happen?

**Duplicate Subscriptions:**
- User upgraded from Individual to Team on 2025-10-19
- Upgrade process created new Team subscription but **did not cancel** old Individual subscription
- Result: User billed for both plans ($4.99 + $29.99 = $34.98/month)

**Database Mismatch:**
- Webhook handler for Team subscription creation populated database with wrong values
- Likely used default/fallback values instead of extracting from Stripe subscription object
- Created record with `plan_id='individual'` despite subscription being for Team plan

### Recommended Investigation
Review webhook handler in `backend/modules/stripe-checkout-completion.ts` or similar:
- Check how `plan_id` and `stripe_product_id` are extracted from Stripe subscription
- Verify upgrade flow cancels previous subscription
- Add validation to prevent multiple active subscriptions per user
