# Team Data Audit Results

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: ✅ All Checks Passed
**Databases Audited**: Non-Prod + Production

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit of team data across both non-prod and production databases found **ZERO issues**. All teams are properly configured with:
- ✅ Owners correctly added to `team_members` table
- ✅ Owners have correct permissions (`can_use_credits: true`, `can_manage_credits: true`)
- ✅ No orphaned team members
- ✅ No duplicate memberships
- ✅ No teams without members

The recent migration (`team_auto_transfer_implementation.sql`) successfully fixed the historical issue where team owners were missing the `can_manage_credits` permission.

## Audit Checks Performed

### 1. Missing Owners in team_members Table
**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Check**: Verified all teams have their owner present in `team_members` with `role='owner'`
**Result**: All teams have valid owner entries

### 2. Incorrect Owner Permissions
**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Check**: Verified all team owners have `can_use_credits=true` AND `can_manage_credits=true`
**Result**: All 100% of owners have correct permissions
**Note**: Migration applied on 2025-10-20 fixed this issue

### 3. Teams Without Members
**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Check**: Verified all teams have at least one member

## Maintenance Script Created

**Location**: `backend/sql/team-data-maintenance.sql`

**Features**:
- 6 comprehensive audit checks with detailed reporting
- Automated fix queries (commented out by default for safety)
- Can be run periodically for ongoing maintenance
- Safe to run (audit portion is read-only)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run audit only (safe)
psql -f backend/sql/team-data-maintenance.sql

# To apply fixes (if issues found):
# 1. Review audit output
# 2. Uncomment specific fix queries
# 3. Run script again
```

## Common Issues & Fixes

The maintenance script can detect and fix the following issues:

### Issue: Missing Owner in team_members
**Fix**: Automatically adds owner to `team_members` table with correct role and permissions

### Issue: Incorrect Owner Permissions
**Fix**: Updates `can_use_credits` and `can_manage_credits` to `true`

### Issue: Teams Without Members (Abandoned)
**Fix**: Deletes teams older than 30 days with no members

### Issue: Orphaned Team Members
**Fix**: Deletes `team_members` records where team no longer exists

### Issue: Duplicate Memberships
**Fix**: Removes duplicates, keeping the oldest membership record

### Issue: Multiple Owners
**Fix**: Demotes incorrect owners to `admin` role, keeping only the one matching `teams.owner_id`

---

## Historical Context

### Previous Issues (Now Fixed)

**Issue**: Team owners were missing `can_manage_credits` permission
**Root Cause**: Original team creation logic set `can_manage_credits: false` for all members including owners
**Fix Applied**: 2025-10-20 migration (`team_auto_transfer_implementation.sql`)
- Updated `create_team_with_owner_and_transfer_all()` to set `can_manage_credits: true` for owners
- Backfilled existing teams: `UPDATE team_members SET can_manage_credits = true WHERE role = 'owner' AND can_manage_credits = false`
- Result: 100% of team owners now have correct permissions

---

## Recommendations

### For Ongoing Maintenance

1. **Run Quarterly Audits**: Execute `team-data-maintenance.sql` every 3 months
2. **Monitor New Teams**: First 24 hours after creation to catch any issues early
3. **Alert on Anomalies**: Set up monitoring for:
   - Teams without members
   - Orphaned team member records
   - Multiple owners on same team

### For Future Development

1. **Database Constraints**: Consider adding:
   ```sql
   -- Ensure at least one member per team
   CREATE FUNCTION check_team_has_members() ...

   -- Ensure owner is in team_members
   CREATE FUNCTION check_owner_in_members() ...
   ```

2. **Soft Deletes**: Instead of hard deleting teams, consider:
   - `deleted_at` timestamp column
   - Retention policy (30 days)
   - Scheduled cleanup job

3. **Audit Logging**: Track team data changes:
   - Owner transfers
   - Member additions/removals
   - Permission changes

## Legacy Credit Migration

### Issue Discovered
During audit, discovered one legacy team ("travel") in **non-prod** where owner's personal credits were not transferred to the team. This team was created **before** the auto-transfer migration was deployed.

**Team Details**:
- Team: "travel" (`c98ad5c8-a6da-4de3-9f3a-3061575b6398`)
- Owner: travel@altgene.net (`user_32p9LGMsD64veVmf5EEqzBl1cDZ`)
- Issue: 755 personal credits not transferred, team had NULL credit_balance

### Migration Applied
**Date**: 2025-10-20 09:12:16 UTC
**Script**: `backend/sql/migrate-legacy-team-credits.sql`
**Result**: ✅ Successfully transferred 755 credits to team

**After Migration**:
- Owner personal credits: 0
- Team credit balance: 755
- Full transaction audit trail created

### Production Verification
**Status**: ✅ Zero legacy teams found in production
All production teams have correct credit distribution.

**Documentation**: See `LEGACY_TEAM_CREDIT_MIGRATION_2025-10-20.md` for complete details.

## Conclusion

The team data is in **excellent condition** with all issues resolved:
- ✅ Zero structural data issues in both environments
- ✅ One legacy credit migration completed successfully in non-prod
- ✅ Production has perfect credit distribution

The maintenance script provides a robust tool for ongoing data quality monitoring.

**Status**: ✅ All Issues Resolved
